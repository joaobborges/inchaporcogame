web: python3 server.py
```

The `web:` prefix tells Railway this is a web service that needs a PORT.

### **Step 3: Redeploy**

After deleting the PORT variable (if it exists):
1. Click on your service
2. Go to "Deployments" tab
3. Click the three dots on the latest deployment
4. Click "Redeploy"

### **Step 4: Check the New Logs**

After redeployment, the logs should show:
```
🔍 Raw PORT value from env: 'XXXX'  (where XXXX is a number like 3000, 5000, etc.)
✅ Valid PORT: XXXX
🐷 Starting Incha Porco server...
📡 Binding to 0.0.0.0:XXXX
