## Method 1: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended - 10 minutes)

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account (if you don't have one)
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Follow the registration steps

### Step 2: Upload Your Game to GitHub

1. **Create a new repository:**

2. **Upload your files:**
   - Click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop these files from your computer:
     - `server.py`

     - `Procfile` (we'll create this below)
     - `requirements.txt` (we'll create this below)
   - Click "Commit changes"

### Step 3: Create Required Files

Before uploading, create these two files:

**File 1: `Procfile`** (no extension)
```
web: python3 server.py
```

**File 2: `requirements.txt`**

# No external dependencies needed!

```

## Method 3: Deploy from Railway Dashboard (No Code Upload)

### Step 1: Prepare Files

Make sure your `incha-porco` folder has:
- `server.py`
- `frontend/index.html`
- `Procfile`
- `requirements.txt`

### Step 2: Create ZIP

Zip your entire `incha-porco` folder.

### Step 3: Deploy

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Login with GitHub

4. Select "Empty Project"
5. Click "New" ‚Üí "GitHub Repo" or use CLI to deploy

*Note: Railway works best with GitHub integration*

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Application failed to respond"

**Fix:** Make sure your `server.py` uses Railway's PORT environment variable:

Add this at the top of `server.py`:
```python
import os
PORT = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 8080))
```

And at the bottom, change:
```python
# FROM THIS:
with socketserver.TCPServer(("0.0.0.0", 8080), GameHandler) as httpd:

# TO THIS:
with socketserver.TCPServer(("0.0.0.0", PORT), GameHandler) as httpd:
```

### Issue: "Deployment keeps failing"

1. Check the logs in Railway dashboard
2. Make sure `Procfile` has exactly: `web: python3 server.py`
3. Verify all files uploaded correctly

### Issue: "Can't access the game"

1. Make sure you generated a domain in Railway settings
2. Check if deployment shows "Active" status
3. Try the URL in an incognito window
